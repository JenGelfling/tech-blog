# tech-blog

For this assignment, I created a tech blog where people can sign up and write posts. When signed in, they can write new posts and comment on other posts. If a visitor is not signed in, they will only be able to read posts and the comments on them but cannot write their own.

I created this app using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. I used express, handlebars, node, and sequelize for this project.
